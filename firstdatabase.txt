create a SQLITE database or use an existing database and create a table in the database called "Ages":

CREATE TABLE Ages ( 
  name VARCHAR(128), 
  age INTEGER
)

Then make sure the table is empty by deleting any rows that you previously inserted, and insert these rows and only these rows with the following commands:

DELETE FROM Ages;
INSERT INTO Ages (name, age) VALUES ('Diarmuid', 25);
INSERT INTO Ages (name, age) VALUES ('Astrud', 23);
INSERT INTO Ages (name, age) VALUES ('Renia', 28);
INSERT INTO Ages (name, age) VALUES ('Nerea', 21);

Once the inserts are done, run the following SQL command:

SELECT hex(name || age) AS X FROM Ages ORDER BY X
